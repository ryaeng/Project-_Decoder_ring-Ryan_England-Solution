# Thinkful Decoder Ring Capston Project

In this project I implemented three methods of encoding and decoding strings. Those methods include:
- Caesar - Shifting characters a certain number of letters from their location in the alphabet
- Polybius - Utilizing a 5x5 grid of letters, i/j share coordinate, to pinpoint the characters needed
- Substitution - Substitute each character in a string of characters given a string of 26 unique characters to represent the alphabet

Each function is well written and tested. I thoroughly enjoyed the challenge of working on this project!
